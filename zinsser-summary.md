# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Scott Betts

Zinsser argues for a return to simple and clutter-free writing. He views the tendency to fill writings with ambiguous or disguising language as harmful to writing's purpose. Stating something in plain terms, he asserts, is almost always better than changing the language to sound important. Writers should focus on paring their work to what is essential over multiple drafts. Terminology that fails to “do work” for the writer must be identified and removed, while terminology that assists the reader in understanding the writer's message must be preserved. The ability to do this consistently is the hallmark of a strong writer.
